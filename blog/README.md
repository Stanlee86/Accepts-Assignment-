Using Data Science to Predict Assignment Acceptance in Medical Equipment Suppliers

## Project Motivation
This is the first project on the Udacity data science nanodegree

I used Medical Equipment Suppliers Dataset for this project. The data was gotten from Data.CMS.gov and can be accessed here: https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/search
 
This project examines whether medical equipment suppliers accept assignment, that is, consent to receive direct payment from Medicare at a set rate. Policymakers and service providers can improve their offerings by knowing the elements that affect this acceptability. This research uses Medical equipment suppliers data which is a list of Suppliers that indicates the supplies carried at that location and the supplier's Medicare participation status  to predict supplier assignment acceptance. The project uses logistic regression model to understand key factors influencing assignment acceptance and provides insights into supplier behaviours.


## Libraries Used

The project is implemented using Python 3, here are the libraries I used:

1. matplotlib - used for visualization

2. pandas - used for data manipulation

3. scikit-learn - used for logistic regression modelling

## File Descriptions
1. blogproject.ipynb Jupyter notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations

2. Medical-Equipment-Suppliers.csv Original dataset in csv format
